#CS-430 : Senior Project#

This Semester long project was finaly placed on git during the last two weeks for better version control and hopefully* more colaboration among the team members

##Team Members##
* Jennings
* Forrest
* Shae
* [Nate] [1]

##Educational Goals##
* Embeded systems
* Multi-Threaded architecture
* Fuzzy logic
* Real time systems

##Operating Specifications##
Code was written for RidgeSoft's [IntelliBrain](http://www.ridgesoft.com/intellibrain/intellibrain.htm) micro controler.

This micro controler was mounted on a modified [Axial](http://www.axialracing.com/) RC-car base (Unsure which specific model). This base was modified to have separate front and rear wheel steering. 

###Sensor Configuration###
* 5 [Ping)))](http://www.parallax.com/tabid/768/ProductID/92/Default.aspx) (ultrasonic range sensors) were used at pointed at 0, +-45 and +- 90 degrees from the front of the robot. Some trickery was needed here because the IntelliBrain only supported 4 pulse output devices so a relay was used to switch the signal wires for the East/West looking sensors.
* 1 GPS unit Labled "Paralax GPS Reciever" (no link found)
* 1 Rotation sensor (no link found). Was attached to the large driving output gear.
* 1 Sensor for rear straight driving (yet to be implemented)


###Regular Execution (_coding samples_)
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  // Everything ends here!
  Machine.destroy(everything, now);
}
```
