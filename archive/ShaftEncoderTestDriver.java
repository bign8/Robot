 * 
 * This is the main controller class for the robot. This class exists mainly
 * to easily interface with the robot loading software in order to pick and 
 * choose what code the robot is running.  Therefore, at any given time, 
 * most of the classes that this Controller calls may be commented out.
 * 
 * This class forms the link between the data class and many of the operation
 * classes that rely on that data.
