%---------------- ABSTRACT -------------------%
\begin{abstract}
This documentation outlines the Robot built for CS 430: Senior Project in spring 2012.  It first outlines the semester's work and project goals.

It is written such that one should be able to reconfigure a similar robot to run this code and understand the logic.

There are directions for setting up a development environment to interface with the IntelliBrain2 MicroController in order to load the software with a detailed description and sample load script.

A physical description and a wiring diagram should allow for another student one day to reconstruct a similar robot.

Ultimately, this documentation outlines each piece of logic that controls the robot and describes specific nuances in the logic and the processes that the authors went through.

The authors believe the robotics project to be a great success and good learning opportunity.  Though the robot's navigation skills are currently poor, both it and the developers are young in the art of robotics and hold high hopes for future releases of the robot, dubbed `Dufus.'
